## 🤖 What is Aimbot AI in Warzone?

Unlike old-school rage bots, Aimbot AI uses **adaptive algorithms** to aim based on enemy behavior, positioning, and visibility. It tracks heads, reads movement, and adjusts on the fly to stay looking “legit” – or go full rage mode if you're feeling wild.

Perfect for:

* Legit-style grinders
* Rank pushers
* Streamers using smooth aim
* Or full-on rage builds 😈
